# UEF Backend

Uni Event finder is an application the universities can use to manage events and promote them, so interested students can find and join the events easily. The application helps the users finding suitable events by suggesting the related events based on their profile. There are various parameters that users can set, for example, their major, whether they are open to a job, their interests and hobbies.

### The motivation behind the app

The main idea is to make a better connection between students. There are a lot of events helding at the universities, but the students would not be able to get informed about all of them. So the app helps them finding suitable events.

Furthermore, this application will be especially useful for new international students to find informations about the events, as they don't have any connections when they enter to the university.
